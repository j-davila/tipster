# Pre-work - *tipster*

**tipster** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **José L Dávila Montalvo**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

Had difficulty in the beginning saving user defaults using key value pair, but ultimately understood the concept and implemetation. Struggled with optional feature concepts and implementation.
